                <h4>YOUR NEW CUSTOMER FINANCING PLAN</h4>
                <p>As an alarm dealer and industry financial consultant over the past twenty-five years, I have tried to
                    find a
                    financing program that will meet the needs of dealers who have been searching for a program that does
                    not force them
                    to sell their accounts or risk falling into the insidious trap of deferring the payment of equipment
                    invoices and
                    payroll taxes to try and build some working capital to run their business and still raise a family.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Dealers generally understand the long term value of building equity by keeping all, or most, of their
                    customers, but
                    understanding is not doing. Working capital is difficult to accumulate unless you have other assets or a
                    family that
                    is able to assist you. Everyone should have a business plan that illustrates how they are capitalized
                    and plan to
                    build long term equity.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you are considering joining one of the several dealer purchase programs that pay you a ‘high’
                    multiple for your
                    newly installed accounts, think carefully and spend some time with your business plan. These dealer
                    purchase
                    programs do a good job of building equity and cash flow for themselves. They have you doing the service
                    and
                    replacing their attrition. They take care of themselves, and yes, you get a nice monthly check, but you
                    have to
                    produce every month and when you are ready to “hang-’em-up” all you have left is a pickup and a tool
                    belt.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A solution to this difficult problem is at hand. EQUITY+PLUS is the new financing tool that bridges the
                    cash you
                    need each week with the equity creation that is the promise of tomorrow. Our solution is a short-term
                    loan (36, 42,
                    or 48 mo.) that allows you to pay for the installation of each qualified customer. You will generate
                    immediate cash
                    flow from the customer down payment and the loan advance for your selected term. At the end of that
                    term, each
                    customer will begin paying you directly because each of the customers entering this program continues to
                    belong to
                    you. The terms are simple, the contract processing is quick, and all of the residual cash flow will
                    belong to you.
                </p>
                <h4>For whom is this new EQUITY+PLUS financing program designed?</h4>
                <p>1. Dealers who are installing new accounts with low or non-existent installation fees.
                    <br>2. Dealers who understand that selling their alarm contracts does not build equity for the future.
                    <br>3. Dealers who do not have the capital to invest in their businesses.
                    <br>4. Dealers who have a reasonable net creation cost.
                    <br>5. Dealers who understand their responsibility to install systems in a professional manner and to
                    service them
                    in a timely fashion.
                    <br>6. Dealers who thought that their only alternative is to sell accounts to a Dealer Purchase Program.
                    <br>7. Dealers who understand the value of a recurring cash flow cushion to protect themselves when
                    times are slow.
                    <br>8. Dealers who want to build cash flow for retirement, sending kids to college, or to travel to
                    places they can
                    only dream about now.
                </p>
                <h4>EQUITY+PLUS Program Highlights:</h4>
                <p>1. The Dealer is borrowing the needed funding and not selling the contracts.
                    <br>2. Customer contracts funded for a loan term of 36, 42, or 48 months or a term that meets your
                    special needs.
                    <br>3. Funding advance multiples are very competitive with traditional loan terms and conditions.
                    <br>4. Funding is targeted to be 48 hours after receipt of completed and verified paperwork.
                    <br>5. Customer credit checks limited to $20 per month to the dealer.
                    <br>6. Internet-based credit approval in minutes by smart phone or tablet.
                    <br>7. Advance funding will reflect prepayment of monitoring costs for the loan term.
                    <br>8. Pass-thru costs, such as Alarm.com, will be added to the monitoring rates to determine the
                    overall monitoring
                    prepayment.
                    <br>9. Dealer monitoring costs and pass-thru’s may be less than the rates paid monthly because they are
                    prepaid for the
                    entire term.
                    <br>10. Dealers may use their own signs and stickers to build name recognition and brand their service.
                    <br>11. Customer billing and collections are done by the funder at their expense and in the name of the
                    dealer.
                    <br>12. Qualified customers must be homeowners with 640+ credit ensuring that the dealer will have high
                    quality
                    customers who will stay with them for many years after the financing term.
                    <br>13. Dealer has no financial or operating responsibilities, other than service and aiding collections
                    for the
                    life of the loan.
                    <br>14. Dealer may fund any RMR amount up to a reasonable maximum (which is presently $99) based on the cost
                    of the
                    equipment, installation charges, and amount of pass-thru’s.
                    <br>15. Dealer management and supervision of the customer’s needs means lower attrition.
                    <br>16. Dealer receives all leads and referrals received by funder or central station.
                    <br>17. Dealer does not have to sign a UCC-1 document.
                    <br>18. This program is non-exclusive and the dealer may opt out at any time by providing notice to the
                    Funder.
                </p>

                    <br>12. Loan advances are based on the loan term. A 36 mo. term is a 23x advance, a 42 mo. term is a 26x
                    advance,
                    and a 48 mo. term is a 30x advance to the dealer.

                <h4>Why we call this program EQUITY+PLUS:</h4>
                <p>Quite simply, we all get into the security business so we can build for our future while doing something
                    we can be
                    proud of. Protecting our families and communities is very satisfying as a profession, but that is only
                    half of it if
                    we are not also building equity for our future.
                    Let’s take a quick look at how quickly your equity will build with just 20 installations per month. Our
                    financing
                    program will allow you to compete with bigger companies while providing the capital you need to maintain
                    your cash
                    flows.</p>
